	 * 
The SWT Snippets give examples for stand-alone SWT applications using different kinds of SWT widgets. 
The SWT Snippet site is located at the following URL: http://www.eclipse.org/swt/snippets/.

You can copy these snippets and paste them directly into Eclipse on a Java package. Eclipse will automatically create the Java class for you.

If you do this on a project which has SWT already available, the snippet can be started immediately.

The SWT Examples page provides useful programs that are written in SWT. These are typically much larger and more comprehensive than SWT Snippets.
The SWT Examples are located at the following URL: http://www.eclipse.org/swt/examples.php

In addition the Eclipse Nebula project provides additional widgets for SWT. The homepage can be found at the URL: http://eclipse.org/nebula/

Another source for SWT widgets is the Opal widget homepage: http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/opal/
