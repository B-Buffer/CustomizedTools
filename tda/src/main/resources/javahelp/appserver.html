            Starting with Sun's JDK 1.5 it is quite easy to get information about a badly behaving application in a production environment using the JVM tools jmap and jstack. Jmap fetches a heap dump from the VM the application is running in and jstack fetches the thread dumps. These information can be taken from the server the application server is running on and analyzed offline. Even without remote access to the server you still can get these dumps from your customer. Many Monitoring tools usually need some kind of remote access.

            Imagine a customer's web application with a lot of concurrent users accessing the system and the system is under heavy load. The system is only accessed during office hours. But you have noticed the load of the system stays high in the night although nobody is accessing it. What can you do?
